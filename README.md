# BlackJackGame
Took the blackJake game created by scrimba and did a little spin. 
Finished the Game before the tutorial was done and added extra features like a "stay" and "reset game" feature so you dont have to refresh the page everytime you want to play again. I also made it so you are playing agains the dealer so that it was just you trying to get 21 everytime but you are actually playing against someone. 
This was a fun project that only took a couple hours and it helped me reinforce my array, if/else, loops and dom knowledge. On top of that it was fun for my kids to learn blackjack!
